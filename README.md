Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project involved designing a system for a client named DriverPass, which provides online practice exams and on-the-road training to help students pass their driving tests. The client wanted a system that allowed students to schedule lessons, take practice exams, track their progress, and receive feedback from instructors. Additionally, the system had to include functionality for managing user accounts and handling administrative tasks such as managing appointments and driving packages.
What did you do particularly well?
One aspect of the project I did particularly well was clearly identifying and organizing the use cases and actors in the UML diagrams. This helped me ensure the system's functionality was well-structured and easy to understand.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise one part of my work, I would focus on improving the clarity and detail of the nonfunctional requirements. By refining aspects like system performance and security specifications, I could better communicate the technical expectations for the system's infrastructure and future scalability.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
To interpret the user’s needs, I carefully analyzed the business requirements document and the interview transcript to understand what each user—whether a student, instructor, or admin—needed from the system. Implementing their needs into the system design ensured the final product aligned with their goals. It is crucial to consider user needs in system design because the system’s functionality and success depend on how well it serves those who use it.
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When designing software, I approach it by thoroughly gathering and analyzing user requirements, creating clear and detailed models (such as UML diagrams), and considering both functional and nonfunctional requirements. In the future, I plan to use techniques like iterative design and user feedback loops to continuously refine and improve the system throughout the development process. This strategy ensures that the system meets user needs while maintaining technical integrity.
